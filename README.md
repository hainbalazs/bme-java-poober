# Poober

This repository contains a full-stack enterprise level application built on top of SpringBoot and QT frameworks, which can be deployed to IoT devices as a Yocto projec. It was created as a course project for Application Development Environments (VIAUAC04) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

## Technical stack, functionalities
Basic tasks (with maximum points available):
- [x] 7p: Yocto project based server or client (once per homework)
- [x] 7p: QML-based graphical user interface (including at least one graph or other drawing, one list, and one menu)
- [x] 7p: REST API (including new data creation, query, data modification, with logically structured URLs)
- [x] 8p: Support for multiple users, authentication and different roles.
- [x] 15p: Create a device driver under Linux
- [x] 5p: Servers communicating with asynchronous message queues (i.e. multiple backend components).
- [x] 5p: Using Java Persistence API with at least 5 classes.
- [x] 2p: Use Spring Data
- [x] 3p: Dependency injection based on Spring
- [x] 5p: Appropriate security precautions (authorization, SQL injection prevention, server-side validation, secure password storage, etc.)
- [x] 3p: Use logging mechanism with loglevel support.
Bonus tasks that may require extra follow-up (with maximum points available only if at least 30 points from the basic tasks are accumulated in time):
- [x] 5p: Create a Linux installation package
- [x] 5p: Scheduled tasks in the backend.
- [x] 5p: Create an interrupt handler under Linux
- [x] 5p: Sending emails in the backend.
- [x] 3p: Use QRC mechanism to store and access non-QML files.
